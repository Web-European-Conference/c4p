I will show how to keep your software up to date without any effort (as long as there are some tests). You can automatically upgrade dependencies for an individual project, a collection of projects. You can even see the anonymous version upgrade results across the public projects around the world to judge if a particular update is likely to succeed. What about projects that depend on your software? Before releasing a new version, you can test some or all of your dependencies against the new code. I hope that anyone trying to work around the problem of keeping the modules working together and being up to date will find my approach very useful.",

        "description": "Code coverage tools are extremely useful, yet they show what the final coverage looks like. In the most development setups, the individual commits are cherry picked from the development to the staging to the production branch. The final coverage might be very different after some updates are transferred and merged. I will show two separate tools that enhance the code coverage computed from unit tests. First, there is a code coverage proxy `was-tested` that I wrote. It collects code coverage information during end 2 end feature testing, usually performed by the QA people. This is extremely valuable, because most of the front-end code is extremely time consuming to test using automated tests. Second, I wrote tested-commits tool that takes any code coverage information and splits it back to coverage by an individual commit. Thus we can track how much we have tested each feature / bug fix that merged and moved around the branches. Taken together, we can reliably speak about each feature tested at 90% before being deployed to production, even if the testing is manual.",

The following topics will be shown: procedural (imperative) style, object-oriented, functional, point-free, lazy evaluation, immutable data, async processing using promises, async processing using event emitters, advanced topics: transducers and streams, reactive programming using event streams. Any team looking to improve its code should attend this presentation. Making a single leap from object-oriented approach to reactive programming is too difficult, but you can make it step by step.",

Then the Clojure world brought us transducers. They redefine the idea of processing a sequence encompassing the usual map, reduce, and filter functions, and can be applied to both synchronous and asynchronous computations.

To further build on that vision, Microsoft recently released a preview of “Monaco”, a new development service specifically designed for building and maintaining Microsoft Azure Websites. With Monaco, Microsoft provides developers with a lightweight, friction free companion to the Visual Studio IDE that is accessible from any device on any platform. It is a rich, browser based, code focused development environment optimized for the Microsoft Azure platform, making it easy to start building and maintaining applications for the cloud. In this session we will walk you through this exciting new Microsoft Azure service, show you how fast you can make changes in Monaco and how the online experience can speed up your development and offers you an even greater set of tools than the ones you already use every day. We will talk about more advanced scenarios, and show you how the extensions work, how you can leverage Git and TFS source control in combination with Monaco, and how you can even make live changes, compile them and have them reflected immediately online.",

This is my love story with cross-platform mobile frameworks. In this talk we'll speak about the existent cross-platform mobile frameworks, talking openly about weaknesses, strengths and myths present in cross platforms, from the point of view of a newbie mobile developer.

As a developer, it's not yet clear why to start developing on ASP.NET 5 or, more importantly, why to move an existing, healthy project to it. I hear a lot of Questions like: 'wow, it wasn't like that before, why has it changed?' 'I'm not familiar with these concepts, so should I stick with [the thing that I am using now]?'. In this talk, I'll cover the reasons why you should start considering ASP.NET 5 by boiling it down to the tried-and-tested format: 10 top features. We'll cover everything from new project structures to unified MVC and Web API frameworks, complete with samples and clear explanations of how these things are going to affect the way you code and the way you build projects. Along the way, we'll cover other little gems like the new Configuration framework. By the end of the talk, the advantages - and potential pitfalls - of using ASP.NET 5 in terms of both runtime and development process should be crystal clear, and you'll be able to work out when's the right time to start using the latest shiny Microsoft bits.",

You will also get familiar with libraries that extend the functional capabilities of JavaScript (lodash and FunctionalJS) and the upcoming ES6 features that make JavaScript even more functional.",

The ES Commitee also uncovered plans for the future editions of the language (ES7 and beyond). It's time we started getting to know all new features that we will all be using in a few years time. Actually, we can do even better! We can start using the most interesting and useful features right now thanks to ES6 compilers like Google's Traceur. They will translate the new ES6 code to its ES5 equivalent form, which our current browsers can understand and execute.

Those hundreds of lines of code could benefit a lot from being unit tested. Seriously, it could possibly save you a lot of problems down the line when you add a new feature without realizing that it breaks something else in the system. With tests in place you will know immediately (even right after saving the file with the new code changes). Without tests you will learn about it from your QA staff (if you’re lucky enough to have them) or from your end customer.

However, having a closer look you don’t really see much revolutionary stuff in those new frameworks - they are usually just a small step forward from the previous thing. At least that’s how I felt in the past few years of doing JavaScript. Until I discovered Meteor, that is. It was enough to complete the getting started tutorial to realise that I’m dealing with a potential game-changer. First imagine that all communications happen via web sockets (way faster than REST API calls over HTTP). Then realise that you have a full blown MongoDB implementation accessible on the client side. Finally, remember that from now on you just need one programming language - JavaScript - to implement the whole application - from the client-side through to the back-end and all the way down to the database. In this talk you will see all this goodness brought together in one great package that is called Meteor.",

Most modern web applications need to be highly available, and this also means that it should be up during the deployments. This obviously goes for HTTP based services, too (a.k.a. RESTful APIs). In these cases, dealing with zero-downtime deployments is a challenge, and there is no easy solution to this challenge. Moreover, the solutions available vary based on the number of integrated clients, which parts of the World it addresses, how many active users it has... Isn't there a simple way to figure out how to get there? Join me to get into the details of the key steps on your path to zero downtime deployments. Learn about the patterns, practices and techniques that make it easier, such as incremental deployments, applying semantic versioning to HTTP applications and blue/green deployments. We'll also walk through an end-to-end demo of how a high traffic web application can survive the challenge of deployments. What seemed insurmountable at the start of the session will be practical and applicable by the time we're finished, and you should be able to see how to start moving your production application close to the zero-downtime gold standard.",

On the other side, there are many cases where you may want just to expose data using the classical CRUD. Furthermore, the nature of REST is schema-less that is an advantage from a versioning standpoint but it can be harder to browse for many clients. In this session, we will start discussing OData vs REST, then examine the v4 OASIS standard and dig into many samples and tools to rapidly start coding OData services.",
